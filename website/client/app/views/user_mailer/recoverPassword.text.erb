Haigy Password Recovery
===============================================


Dear <%= @user.nickname %>,

If you've requested a password recovery from Haigy.com, your temporary password is:

<%= @temporaryPassword %>

You may sign in Haigy.com with this temporary password within next <%= @temporaryPasswordLifetimeInMinutes %> minutes, and reset your password through the Account Management page.

If you've received this mail in error, it's likely that another user entered your email address by mistake while trying to reset a password. If you didn't initiate the request, you don't need to take any further action and can safely disregard this email.


Best,
