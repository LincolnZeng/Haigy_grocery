        Why does Haigy buy some groceries from Whole Foods Market?
      </div>
      <div class="content">
        <p>We wish to keep lean and focused to provide our customers the best fruit and vegetable delivery service. However, we understood that it is convenient if our customers could buy everything on one shop. We decided to buy anything we donâ€™t have from Whole Foods Market because of their quality of products. We wish our customers could get other groceries as good quality as fruits and vegetables they get from us.</p>

        How are Whole Foods Market items priced on Haigy?

        <p>In the beta test, the price is the same as the real time price of the Whole Foods Market's Berkeley store. However, there might be a small amount of the handling fee in the future.</p>

        <i class="dropdown icon"></i>
        How do I return items?
      </div>
